SNOMED CT DATABASE LOAD SCRIPTS
===============================
Scripts to build a transitive closure table from an RF2, snapshot,
inferred SNOMED CT relationships file, create and populate a MySQL,
Postgres, or Oracle database with a SNOMED CT terminology release in RF2.

*New feature: a "depth" flag is now computed as well where 0 means "self",
1 means "child", and >1 means "non-child descendant".  This enables asking
queries about "child of", "descendant of", and "descendant or self of".
