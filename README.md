SNOMED CT DATABASE LOAD SCRIPTS
===============================
Scripts to build a transitive closure table from an RF2, snapshot,
inferred SNOMED CT relationships file, create and populate a MySQL,
Postgres, or Oracle database with a SNOMED CT terminology release in RF2.

To download a package built for the latest US or International edition, visit

*New feature: a "depth" flag is now computed as well where 0 means "self",
1 means "child", and >1 means "non-child descendant".  This enables asking
queries about "child of", "descendant of", and "descendant or self of".

Minimum Specification
---------------------
- MySQL v8.+, MariaDB 10.+, MariaDB 11.+
  - MySQL v8 requires the server to run with "--local_infile=ON"
- Oracle v12.+
- Postgres v13.+, v14.+, v15.+, v16.+

Prerequisites
-------------
If loading transitive closure table into a database, first load SNOMED in RF2
using the database load scripts you can also find at the URL above.  This is
important because it creates a view that allows for denormalization of preferred
concept names, thus making the transitive closure table more useful.

Installation
------------
* See [HOWTO.md](src/main/resources/HOWTO.md) file to understand how to load the rf2 files into the database

TODO
----
Next Steps:
* Better automated QA to validate file sizes against table sizes
* Better automated QA to validate views have same row count as driving tables
